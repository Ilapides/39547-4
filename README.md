Points 10  
Submitting https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yW1-2sjGvPGzy2Gxdhb8cyrEGeRdegMzfABKS6QVTlA/edit?usp=sharing  

Goal:  
Recreate Assignment 3 using React. Should not be using any DOM methods… the assignment should be done entirely using React!  
Direction:  
For each user story, make a feature branch. Try to commit often and commit frequently on each feature branch. Make sure you are creating and assigning issues. Remember, try to have your branches named as closely to the issue it is intended to build out. Do not forget to type in “closes #” in the body of Pull Requests to close associated issues.  
DO NOT DELETE YOUR FEATURE BRANCHES. Keep them even after they are merged :)  
NOTE: do not push node_modules to your git repos! You should have node_modules in your .gitignore file. Please message me if you don’t know how to set that up.    

Assignment:
Based on the in-class demonstration, complete the following user stories:
As a user, I can:
add rows to the grid  
add columns to the grid  
remove rows from the grid  
remove columns from the grid  
select a color from a dropdown menu of colors  
click on a single cell, changing its color to the currently selected color  
fill all uncolored cells with the currently selected color  
fill all cells with the currently selected color  
clear all cells/restore all cells to their original/initial color  
click and hold (mouseover) from a single cell (start) to a different cell (end) such that all affected/hovered-over cells from start to end change to the currently selected color  

Grading criteria:

All solutions should explicitly fulfill the requirements noted in each problem.
